## AI-Based Development with Open Interpreter and Jupyter

At the core of rUv-dev are two powerful tools: Open Interpreter and Jupyter Notebook.


## Features

### liteLLM Integration

rUv-dev seamlessly integrates with liteLLM, a lightweight and efficient library for working with large language models. With liteLLM, you can:

- 🌐 Access a wide range of LLM providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, Cohere, Azure OpenAI, and Replicate.
- 🔑 Securely store and manage API keys for different LLM providers.
- 🚀 Optimize LLM performance with features like streaming, caching, and rate limiting.
- 🔧 Customize LLM behavior with advanced settings like context window size, API versions, and proxy servers.

### Open Interpreter Integration

Open Interpreter is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with AI models using natural language. With Open Interpreter, you can:

- 💬 Describe your coding goals in plain English and let AI generate the corresponding code.
- 🌐 Access a wide range of AI models and libraries, including OpenAI and Anthropic.
- 🔧 Customize Open Interpreter's behavior and preferences to suit your coding style.
- 🔒 Ensure secure code execution with isolation and safe mode settings.
- 📊 Integrate with Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding and data visualization.

### Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook is an interactive development environment that allows you to combine code, visualizations, and explanatory text in a single document. With Jupyter Notebook, you can:

- 📝 Create and share interactive coding notebooks with embedded AI-generated code snippets.
- 📊 Visualize data and results using a variety of charting libraries and tools.
- 🎨 Collaborate with others by sharing and versioning your Jupyter notebooks.
